<--Task1-->
 ==>purpose of making constructor as private with example
       *We can declare a constructor as private using the pirvate access specifier,and also we cannot create an object
       *Private constructors allow us to restrict the instantiation of a class.   

<--Task2-->
  ==>can i make constr as final - impact
      *when you declare a variable as final, it means that the variable's value cannot be changed once it has been initialized. 
       If you're referring to making a constructor final.
      *That's not possible because constructors are not methods that can be overridden, hence the concept of making them final doesn't apply.

<--Task3-->
==>if a keep int nearby constr - what happens
        int Constr() {
		  *if a keep int nearby constr we have to  add the 
       return statement and it will be considered as method
      *Requires return type or change it to void
	}

==>class emp {
    private static int count = 0; // static variable to count the number of objects
    public emp() {
        count++; 
    }
    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        emp a = new emp();
        emp b = new emp();
        emp c = new emp();
        emp d = new emp();
        emp e = new emp();
     System.out.println("Number of emp objects created: " + emp.getCount());
    }
}
 Output :
 Number of emp objects created: 5

//float r=2.5f % 2; //0.5 --commented ----> how is this 0.5 comes as result?
    * In the expression float r = 2.5f % 2;, % is the modulo operator. It calculates the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand. 
       in this 2.5f is divided by 2.
    * When you divide 2.5f by 2, the quotient is 1 with a remainder of 0.5.
 
    float r=2.5f / 2; //1.25(takes quotient as result)
	   System.out.println(r);
	float s=2.5f % 2; //0.5(takes remainder as result) 
       System.out.println(s);
